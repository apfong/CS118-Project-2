# CS118 Project 2

Template for for [CS118 Spring 2016 Project 2](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring16/cs118/project-2.html) 

## Makefile

This provides a couple make targets for things.
By default (all target), it makes the `server` and `client` executables.

It provides a `clean` target, and `tarball` target to create the submission file as well.

You will need to modify the `Makefile` to add your userid for the `.tar.gz` turn-in at the top of the file.

## Provided Files

`server.cpp` and `client.cpp` are the entry points for the server and client part of the project.
